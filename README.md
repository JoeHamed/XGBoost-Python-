# XGBoost Classification Model

- This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a machine learning classification model using the XGBoost algorithm.
- The dataset is processed, split into training and test sets, and the model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, accuracy score, and k-fold cross-validation.

## Introduction

This project uses the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm for classification tasks. The dataset is first preprocessed to handle imbalanced classes, then split into training and test sets. The model is trained and evaluated, and performance metrics are generated, including a confusion matrix and cross-validation accuracy.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```
